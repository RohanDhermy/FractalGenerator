# FractalGenerator
Program that allows the user to select the depth, ratio, and colors for fractals to be drawn as a Prickly Pear Cactus plant. The user selects the depth, the ratio from parent to child, the color of the cactus, and the color of the pear using the widgets on the GUI and the program will paint the fractal for them.
